## Design goals

TODO: to write



## Formalization

Note: These are incomplete design notes.

A regression test is given by:

1. A log set. These are either physical logs or just
2. One or more log processors. These take a bag and write a bag. Multiple bags are merged.

3. One or more visualizers.
4. One of more statistics.
5. Acceptance conditions.

The regression test engine does the following.

It reads the log test. It makes the logs available. (This might imply downloading
the logs.)


A physical log is a physical .bag file. These are generated
